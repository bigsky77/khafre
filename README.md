### Khafre

Have you ever been lost inside a **MASSIVE** code base or complex system? What if you wanted high-level analysis of the system without getting lost in the weeds?

Inspired by [this post](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code/twitter-the-algorithm-analysis-deeplake.html?highlight=twitter) setting up the analysis of the Twitter algorithm.

**Khafre** is designed to take any arbitrary-sized codebase alongside questions about that codebase and generate a simple and high-level overview of those answers. Even better, the system is designed to post those answers directly to Twitter in the form of fully curated tweets.

Our steps are to integrate multiple systems and inputs.
